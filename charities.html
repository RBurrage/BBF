                        <h5>Support for Local Charities</h5>
                        <p>Boston Boxing is reaching out to local businesses as a means of raising money for our charities through advertising and sponsorship opportunities during our Fight Nights. We offer the following options for sponsorship:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sponsorship Plan 1 – Fight Night Programs:</strong>  Program advertisements cost $75 for a coupon to $300 for a full page ad, with $125 quarter page and $200 half page options in between. For an additional $25, the ad will be in color. Programs are printed on 11x17” paper and folded in half, so each page is 8.5x11”. Your advertisement will appear in all of our programs from April 2016 through March 2017 and will be seen by the local community on an almost monthly basis. </li>

                        <li><strong>Sponsorship Plan 2 -  Fight Night Sponsorship for $500:</strong> Includes a banner in the gym year round and a table at all Fight Nights, as well as an ad in the boob as one of our feature sponsorships. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Please consider sponsoring to not only support a great cause but to receive some great publicity in the local community. For more information, email info@bostonboxing.com. If you have not yet been to the gym and would like to stop for a complimentary class to see what we are all about, please join us any Monday at 6pm.</p>
